# Contributing

First of all, thank you for your interest in contributing! It is greatly appreciated whether its a small typo, patch with fixes, or new feature.
However, before you check your code in be sure to adhere to the following rules!

## Branch Naming

Please use `[github username]/[issue id]-[short description]` for your branch naming schema. If there is no issue for the branch you are creating, 
than prefix it with whether it is a `fix, feature, doc, security`. Here are a few examples:

```sh
# Simple
octocat/1-patch-readme

# With Issue
mbround18/2-add-new-authorizor

# No Issue
mbround18/fix-http-get-route

mbround18/feature-new-auth-platform

mbround18/doc-minor-readme-typo
```


## Commits

When comitting, its fine to have short commits or using or own style but this repository uses squash and merge for pull requests. 


## Pull Requests

Similar to branch naming, prefix your pull request with `fix, feature, doc, security` and give it a slightly more verbose title than the branch name. 
Then in the pull request use the template provided to include details about whats changed. Example title:

```sh
[Fix] Minor data issue on token events
```
